Our first quarter results represented solid progress in the continuation of the positive momentum from the third and fourth quarters, with stronger revenue growth and significant margin expansion. Revenue as reported was up 5.3% year-to-year, which translates to underlying core organic growth of over 6.5% after allowing for acquisition, divestiture and exchange rate effects. This is the highest growth rate we have seen since 2014. Although we continue to feel the cyclical effects for agriculture and oil and gas, the increasing growth rate reflects our mitigation efforts in the affected businesses as well as our focus on alternative growth components in the portfolio.
 Our non-GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 17.8%, up 2.7 points from last year, and reflected operating leverage of 67%, which was enabled by tight cost control, which held non-GAAP expenses flat year-to-year. Operating leverage, which has been and will be the central driver of continuing margin expansion, was 44% for the last trailing 12-month period.
 Our full year 2017 outlook remains basically unchanged from prior commentary and anticipates further step-ups in revenue growth and margin expansion as the year goes on. The expectation for the full year is for single-digit organic growth, with the potential boost by a couple of points of the acquisition growth. We expect the second half's organic performance to be relatively stronger than the first half. In addition, we expect the effect of acquisitions made during the year to add multiple gross points in the second half.The international market outlook remains generally favorable, with some very hot regional markets. Europe, Asia Pacific and most other regions are outpacing North American growth. The environment in the U.S. is relatively uncertain while awaiting policy outcomes on infrastructure spend, tax reform and trade policy.
Our forecasts have never banked to significant impact from increased infrastructure spend, and it will represent a potential net upside to the forecast if it happens. Tax reform is likely to have a positive direct and indirect effects, but with a qualification, if it impacts cross-border transactions. Increased trade protection would be negative.
Given the possibility of increased infrastructure spending, we have stepped up our engagement at the federal level, with the aim of promoting the power of technology to build infrastructure better, faster and cheaper. We are also increasing our efforts with the 50 states, anticipating that actual spending decisions will be made at that level as well as recognizing that many states have taken the initiative to increase spending, independent of federal action. Today is the first time we have reported using our new segments. This change represents the evolution of our business in our markets and brings better balance to the reporting segments, enables improved transparency and better enables us to articulate the Trimble narrative to our investors. We appreciate that this is a change for the analyst and the investor community, which has grown accustomed to the segmentation we last adjusted in 2006. Rob will walk you through the details.
 The second half of 2016 and early 2017 represents a period of strong innovation in Trimble, with the implications for both the short term and long term competitive positioning. Let me provide a few examples, along with a summary of the status of the segments.
 The Geospatial segment, net of divestitures and acquisitions, grew year-to-year for the first time since 2014. The SX10 product, our scanning total station, which was released in the fourth quarter, has redefined the product category and is a market hit without an effect of competitive response. We left the quarter with a strong backlog for the product and are ramping up manufacturing to meet the demand. Businesses within the segment are also benefiting from increased investments in autonomy, which require both precise positioning and better maps.
 In the Buildings and Infrastructures segment, the recent CONEXPO trade show provided us with an opportunity to showcase both our role at the center of the information ecosystem for the civil engineering market and the advantage of being a provider of hardware and software bundles. Trimble technology had a visible presence in 18 equivalent manufacturers' booths. Our presence on these machines provides the platform on which to sell future information solutions. At the show, we announced a number of new solutions, with particular emphasis on the new machine controlled product platform. Part of the inaugural launch was the industry's first integrated 3D aftermarket excavator, which represents a significant step towards greater automation. In the Buildings component of the segment, we saw double-digit increases in most of the businesses, including Manhattan Software.
 In the Resources and Utilities segment, the agriculture business reflected relatively healthy performance, particularly considering that we have not exited the cycle. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with Valley Irrigation that provides us with immediate access to a targeted and well-developed distribution channel for our irrigation technology. The early results have been positive, and the increased scale will enable us to intensify our innovation efforts in the irrigation.
 Our Transportation segment produced strong revenue growth in the quarter, with the mobility businesses in the U.S., India and Europe reflecting currency adjusted double-digit growth. Product innovation, together with ELD mandate in the U.S., helped propel this growth. Our emphasis on focusing on profitable growth platforms continued in the quarter. In the first quarter, we divested our ThingMagic business, which was discussed on the last call. We also divested a small non-core crane lifting system business to focus more aggressively on wireless solutions for cranes. In addition, we have eliminated a number of small manufacturing sites that were acquired through acquisition. We either made or announced a number of small acquisitions in the quarter to extend our information solution franchises for rail and forestry. We closed the transaction for Beena Vision in the Transportation segment in the quarter, which was discussed in the last call. Although we seldom use the Internet of Things terminology, the combination of Beena Vision with our existing rail information capabilities is a real example of the power of the term. The prospects for us in this large market are interesting, and early results are encouraging. We also announced 3 acquisitions in our forestry business, within the new resources in Utilities segment, which, in combination with our existing forestry assets, puts us in a unique and central position to redefine the forestry workflow. Our connected forest solutions manage the full raw materials life cycle of planning, planting, growing, harvesting, transporting and processing. By encompassing the entire workflow, we have the opportunity of eliminating historical points of friction and delivering transformative outcomes. Let me turn the call over to Rob for more detail.
 In summary, the outlook for 2017 continues to be positive, with an opportunity for an increasing levels of revenue, growth and margin expansion. Our improving financial model provides a scope to place increased emphasis on discreet growth initiatives, with the aim of building momentum into 2018. Examples include the accelerating conversion of traditional software license models to SaaS models, the continuing investment in Trimble Connect, the development of our data and software capability in agriculture, the development of driver communities and third-party logistics providers in transportation and the development of autonomy concepts. With the strategic foundations we have in place, we also see the opportunity to capture network effects and to build stronger franchises in our existing verticals through targeted, accretive acquisitions.
